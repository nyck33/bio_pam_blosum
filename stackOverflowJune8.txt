I am testing under the exact same conditions locally and 
My global and local alignment app: https://bio-pam-blosum.herokuapp.com/entrez-parameters

is incomplete but works locally following instructions on the intro page (please enter a valid email address) for the same version I git pushed which then gets tested on CircleCI with very simple Selenium tests (only checking for text of H2 and H3 elements as I am new to Selenium and don't know how to write tests for this problem yet) that pass both locally and on the platform before being pushed to Heroku.  

It is built with Plotly Dash so I make sure I run `app.run_server()` without `debug=True` and turn off callback exceptions when pushing to what I am calling production although it is incomplete.  I test under same conditions locally and get the output I need so I can then make an aligned fasta file (between 2 protein sequences) and download the file to upload to the Alignment Chart on the other page in the app.

Does anybody have any idea why the two global and local alignment methods executed when "Run Needleman-Wunsch" and "Run Smith Waterman" buttons near the bottom are pressed are not showing any output nor seem to be executing at all when deployed?
