# bio_pam_blosum

A simple app made with Plotly Dash with Biopython backend for performing Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman global and local alignments of protein sequences.  

Also BLASTp is implemented using Biopython.

API calls to NCBI are made using Biopython.

A [demo video](https://youtu.be/R9u_kV_8vPc) shows basic usage for some of the features.

The author, Nobutaka Kim, used a conda environment but other virtual environments should work using the requirements.txt
